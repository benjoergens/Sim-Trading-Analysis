# Sim-Trading-Analysis
Simulated FX Trading Analysis Project:

Completed 3/11/2024, this project uses Plotly to chart Buys and Sells (from _trades.csv files), Bids and Asks (from _md.csv files), Aggregate Mark-Out curves, and Mark-to-Market PnL curves for four different hypothetical FX instruments (BTA, GMMA, LMDA, and ZTA).

See Python code in Sim_Trading.py. The market data (_md.csv files) for each of the four hypothetical instruments is extensive (>1.7M rows of bid/ask prices for 100 millisecond horizon ticks), and has been compressed and attached as .zip's.

Example Output for BTA:
