# Sim-Trading-Analysis
Simulated FX Trading Analysis Project:

Completed 3/11/2024, this project uses Plotly to chart Buys, Sells, Bids, Asks, Aggregate Mark-Out, and Mark-to-Market PnL for four different hypothetical FX instruments (BTA, GMMA, LMDA, and ZTA).

See Python code in Sim_Trading.py. The market data for each of the four hypothetical instruments was too large to upload (>1.7M rows of bid/ask prices for 100 millisecond horizon ticks), so only trades data for each instrument is available here.

Example Output for BTA:
