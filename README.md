# Sim-Trading-Analysis
Simulated FX Trading Analysis Project:

Completed 3/11/2024, this project uses Plotly to chart Buys, Sells, Bids, Asks, Aggregate Mark-Out, and Mark-to-Market PnL for four different hypothetical instruments (BTA, GMMA, LMDA, and ZTA).

See Python code in Sim_Trading.py.

(The market data for each of the four hypothetical instruments was to large to upload (>1.7M rows of 100 millisecond horizon tick data), so only trades data is available here).
